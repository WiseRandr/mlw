# React Native Task Managment (ios only)

## **Prerequisite:**
- Xcode
- Cocoapod
- Node.js (lastest version)
- Simulator from Xcode
- Yarn

## **Steps to start project:**

Let's install all dependencies first. From the terminal run these commands one after the other
1. `yarn install`
2. `npx pod-install ios`

Now we can build and start the app. Run both commands simultanously
- `yarn start`
- `npx react-native run-ios`

*All commands need to run in the root project*
